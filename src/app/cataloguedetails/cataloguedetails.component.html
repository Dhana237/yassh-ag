        CVID is a rare disease that causes low levels of
        antibodies, which are proteins that help the body
        fight infections. People with CVID are more likely to
        get infections, especially in the lungs, sinuses, and
        ears. They may also experience inflammation of the
        gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to diarrhea and
        weight loss.

              Biotin is necessary for formation of fatty acids and
              glucose, which are used as fuels by the body. It is
              also important for the metabolism of amino acids and
              carbohydrates. A lack of biotin is rare. However, if
              it occurs it may lead to skin rash, loss of hair, high
              blood levels of cholesterol, and heart problems.
